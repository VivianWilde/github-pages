We&rsquo;ve worked together, casually.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A thief escaped and disappeared into the timestream, stole a list of some sensitive info</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time">Time</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exits: One, presumably a thief</li>
<li>Exit to ancient greece around 500BC, caused a ripple leading to a break in 480.</li>

<ul>
<li>Knights are going to attack the secondhand revolution.</li>
<li>Some are out investigating?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="athens">Athens</h3>
<p>Persian invasion never got this far</p>
<p>It helped with the fleet. s
We had spies in politics.
We had help with the fleet.
Phoenicians helped Persians nuke the fleet.
This is fine.
Battle of Salamas - big battle, Phoenicians + Persians + Ionians vs misc Greeks.
They should have failed, in this timeline they succeeded</p>
<p>500: In Salamas, Th was attacked + captured by pirates, needed to be bailed out by council ransom, lost face.
Ar rose in prestige after that.
Scribe investigated, did the payments, we have a name to seek out.</p>
<h3 id="500">500</h3>
<p>Strange figures arrived recently:
Nobleman with a strange pulsing scar
Athenian, doing an inspection of merchant goods</p>
<p>The nobleman is the more interesting one.</p>
<p>Someone at the docks is basically trafficking/smuggling. Perhaps he&rsquo;s had some business recently.
Odd requests: Scar man wanted something in a box carried to a contact.</p>
<p>Questions: Who was the contact.</p>
<p>Bald man introduced scarman to Man in black, heavily armed</p>
<p>Man in black - Pointy sticks across the chest.
Advanced modern weaponry?</p>
<h4 id="cold-case">Cold case!</h4>
<p>5 hours before we landed, the bald merchant introduced scarman to the man in black</p>
<p>Morgan commits scarman details to memory</p>
<p>Pirate has a bandolier and a bow</p>
<p>Pirate&rsquo;s name: Adamantius</p>
<p>Bald guy: Baldius</p>
<p>Box seems about 10th century, way out of time.
Heavy, probably concerning.</p>
<p>Rosemary got a 20! In a d12 system! WTF!

Tuhorn is talking to a mouse hole.</p>

<h3 id="timeline--new-entries">Timeline (new entries)</h3>
<ul>
<li>9:30-12: Council Meeting</li>
<li>12:30: Tasha visited Alec</li>
<li>~12:30: Tasha got a text from Alex saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you if you tell anyone about this&rdquo;, but previous messages are very chill. So text might be a ruse???</li>
<li>1:30: Tasha working at the union office</li>
<li>3:30 Emergency Meeting: Tasha, Clinton, Doe, Tuhorn, and a full list of others were late and the Lone Master sent a rep.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tasha">Tasha</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alec mentioned Tasha had been acting strange recently</li>
<li>Alec: &ldquo;Tasha knew something before she died.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Tasha had been frantic recently, terrified, not her usual optimistic self. Talking to shady figures (shady by Alec standards). For the past few weeks.</li>
<li>Been running back to her estate mid-day, even missing meetings for it.</li>
<li>Tasha ostensibly never jumped, recently started asking Alec about time tech and trying to acquire a watch (about a month ago)</li>
<li>Potential Lead: Alec put Tasha in touch with some contact about acquiring a watch.</li>
<li>She&rsquo;s been in the knights district frequently.</li>
<li>Potential Lead: Clinton and Tasha had a lot to discuss, and Tasha was raising eyebrows at Clinton in the council meeting on her deathday.</li>
<li>(Probably nothing) Tasha was really into &ldquo;Moon Detective&rdquo;, a bad scifi detective TV show from the 50s.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="estate">Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Holly wanted to buy the estate, pissed that Miri has it</li>
<li>Library: Political structure of the watchtower, and books from across time.</li>
<li>Library: Dr Zephyrs books &ldquo;The Trouble with T.I.M.E&rdquo; about timeline ruptures and stabilisation, and &ldquo;Living your next life: Quasi-temporal revivification&rdquo;. (NOTE: Jane Doe heard a revivification talk in the council, did not like it, for unspecified reasons)</li>
<li>Crest in the wall behind the library.</li>
<li>Golden key on the coffee table, don&rsquo;t know what it unlocks.</li>
<li>Two bedrooms, both in use recently. So Tasha was living with someone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="journal">Journal</h3>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t have enough time. I need to find it before they do.</li>
<li>Selene should know, she&rsquo;s told me so much.</li>
<li>As long as I can get to the other time I can figure out.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no receptacle though, it can&rsquo;t be used&rdquo;.</li>
<li>I feel like I&rsquo;m going crazy</li>
<li>The fact that nobody knows makes them the crazy one.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Worried about Madame E and Selene. Don&rsquo;t know if I can trust them. But I need to know&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s Holly. Something about that mining operation. She&rsquo;s been hiding something from the whole council. Another timeline?&rdquo;</li>
<li>She&rsquo;s not just mining for time fluid.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="corkboard">Corkboard</h3>
<ul>
<li>Found in Tasha&rsquo;s office</li>
<li>Rosemary, Holly, Frog, some businessman, and some mysterious armored figure in the chronoCo column.</li>
<li>Frog: &ldquo;Lost in transit&rdquo;, Armed figure: &ldquo;Tester&rdquo;</li>
<li>Thorwald elsewhere crossed out, &ldquo;knows about it&rdquo; (that is also crossed out), &ldquo;useful idiot&rdquo;</li>
<li>?? over a blue tab (watchers?), pictures of Lone Master, Jane Doe, and Whisperer and the British cane dude (Marlow)</li>
<li>Trashcan has pictures of Madame E and Selene.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="letter">Letter</h3>
<ul>
<li>The letter iRS carefully not frantic, unlike the journal entries from the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="invisible-ink">Invisible Ink</h4>
<ul>
<li>Triplets of numbers, in the form <code>(page, line, char)</code>.</li>
<li>Book key at the top. &ldquo;Time War&rdquo;</li>
<li>Actual message: From Tasha: &ldquo;Night knowledge collected. Worried about watch agent. Buy the wax seal stamp.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Adress: &ldquo;Aunt Mildred&rdquo;, some time-hopping contact. Addressed to Pompeii</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="computer">Computer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Holly ghosted Tasha&rsquo;s attempts to fish for information</li>
<li>Small message group (&ldquo;book club&rdquo;), exchanged book names, possibly a way to share message keys.</li>
<li>Mentions of &ldquo;the end, the storm&rdquo;, ostensibly film. Someone &ldquo;worried about the franchise&rdquo;</li>
<li>Tasha asked Holly for support on making minutemen official faction</li>
<li>Someone (her contact in Pompeii) visited 2 months ago.</li>
<li>3 watchtower agents implicated in this. We have their contacts, need to trace them. Scarred man was probably one of them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="desk">Desk</h3>
<p>Stuff we found in a locked desk drawer. The drawer was booby-trapped with a poison dart, and caught fire once opened.</p>
<h4 id="film--collection-of-disconnected-scenes">Film (Collection of disconnected scenes)</h4>
<ul>
<li>People bowing to a giant gold chronoCo logo and Holly Holland walking out</li>
<li>Mining operations on Earth, probably an alternate-timeline or historical earth. This earth looks less polluted/trashed than ours. Different infrastructure - the mining looks like an entire mining &ldquo;district&rdquo;. Looks like it was built anew, rather than on top of an existing city. Looks like it was built to be a mining operation and has been solely a mining operation for a while. Desert: Bombed/fallout vibes. Building and a pool are the only nice features, and a towel saying &ldquo;LRS&rdquo; (NOTE: Tasha had an LRS handkerchief)</li>
<li>Blue haired middle-aged man: Roughly matches the description of Malachai von Spatz, from the lore. Perhaps a relative or younger version, but perhaps not. Might be an alternate-timeline version of him, but that&rsquo;s unlikely.</li>
<li>Final shot: Icy background, someone looking for something. Right: Orange haired 18 year old waving at camera, points to a tetrahedron.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="letters-archive">Letters Archive</h4>
<ul>
<li>To Tasha: &ldquo;The Last Resort. Enemy of my Enemy. Hall not here.&rdquo; Weeks/months ago</li>
<li>To Tasha: &ldquo;Stealing the Truth, three thirty. Time Man Helping. Distract. Knight Facts Needed.&rdquo; Recent, close to death day</li>
<li>From Tasha: &ldquo;Night knowledge collected. Worried about watch agent. Buy the wax seal stamp.&rdquo; Recent, unsent</li>
<li>We found a receptacle manual</li>
<li>Burned letters: One dates to a year ago.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Time Man helping&rdquo;. And we have a &ldquo;Mr TIME&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="councillors--we-talked-to-holly-and-jane">Councillors (We talked to Holly and Jane)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Purple scarman stole the data</li>
<li>Working for Secondhand Revolution</li>
<li>So Tasha probably was as well</li>
<li>Original scarman died, Jane wants to talk to ours.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="council-meeting">Council Meeting</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tasha was in the 930-12 council meeting.</li>
<li>Tasha defended accepting time refugee. Holland opposes</li>
<li>Zephyr gave a speech on revivification</li>
<li>Tasha argued for making the minutemen official</li>
<li>Some talk about automatons, and updates from knight commander.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="death-valley-knights"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;2024-06-14 Fri&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Death Valley Knights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lord Commander MacIntyre meeting: Internal security (Time MI5)</li>
<li>Stolen intel: 36 hours unaccounted for, enough time for the code to have been decrypted. Could be Hemlock.</li>
<li>Florence Scarred Man: Stole ChronoCo stuff from the tower and fled. Unaffiliated or SecondHand</li>
<li>Salamas Scarred Man: Hemlock.</li>
<li>Goals: Find out where the information went, how it was stolen. Learn about the men and where they came from.</li>
<li>Stolen again somewhere between Florence and Italy.</li>
<li>The missing 36 hours is between the Egypt recovery and the return to Tower custody. Conjecture: Spy in the Wednesday group.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="salamas-guy">Salamas Guy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Was being interrogated by Clinton</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="good-cop-bad-cop">Good Cop Bad Cop</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lightning Gun : Standard High Tech</li>
<li>Eight step plan of world domination</li>
<li>First step: Trickery, done</li>
<li>Second step has happened now. or will happen now. You&rsquo;ll never know.</li>
<li>When the skies turn red and the dinosaurs rain from above.</li>
<li>Reagan: Your opinions wont be what you want, but I assure you we&rsquo;re still evil.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re behind every inconvenience</li>
<li>Third: Those that have risen shall fall, those that fell have already risen and shall rise to the highest spire</li>
<li>Fourth: Be careful what you wish for, those that come. New leaders not who you think they are.</li>
<li>Fifth: Step away from the TIME man.</li>
<li>Percentages, really</li>
<li>Dinosaurs: Maybe a little more literal than metaphorical. You&rsquo;ll see. You have to stop it as it happens, and then before it happens. Some kind of paradox. But he implies it won&rsquo;t stop the overall plan.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cold-case">Cold Case</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cold Case stops 3.5 days ago. I took temporal damage, which is&hellip; bad</li>
<li>In a morgue somewhere, person dressed in clown makeup is above him, and he runs, until pulled into Watcher custody.</li>
<li>So this is the scarman who was killed in Florence.</li>
<li>Timeline is weird.</li>
<li>3.5 days ago in his personal timeline, Salamas man woke up with a clown staring over his head, and got taken into watcher custody - the thing that should have happened to Florence man 6 hours ago.</li>
<li>Likely not receptacle shenanigans, instead time fuckery.</li>
<li>Only possibility (under known rules): At 3.5 days ago, Salamas man was receptacle-possessing Florence man</li>
<li>Internal consistency has been broken</li>
<li>Basically: Cold Case should always respect watchtower time. But, this time, personal time overruled - 3.5 days ago cold-case time was 6 hours ago watchtower time.</li>
<li>Basically: T-3.5d Salamas receptacled into T-6h Florence. And so was receptacled for the resurrection.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="chocolate-croissant">Chocolate Croissant!</h4>
<ul>
<li>TODO I missed some stuff up here, Enigma can fill in</li>
<li>&ldquo;Strange clown has messed up my watch&rdquo;</li>
<li>Messed up: Hint that this was unintentional</li>
<li>&ldquo;Travelled back with my old self, not my new&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Always be a bit behind, provides quite a bit of advantage in the Watchtower&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Enough future knowledge to cause chaos&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Morgana and Breacher are onto you&rdquo; (You as in Hemlock)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="after">After</h4>
<ul>
<li>Salamas man ran out from time labs, Florence came from council. That checks out, Florence guy stole something from the council.</li>
<li>Salamas man knew revivification was in his future, and he was rooting around the lab studying revivification.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-labs">Time Labs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lockdown: Door, windows barricaded</li>
<li>Accident in the labs: Zephyr is trapped, infestation of zombies</li>
<li>Resulted from failed experiments with revivification - the bodies were fine, but failed to bring the minds/brains back (I&rsquo;m hazy on the distincting)</li>
<li>We fought through zombies, saved some, Damien killed a bunch of innocents, yada yada yada</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="footage">Footage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scarred man leaving the lab, corroborates out-of-lab footage.</li>
<li>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t have jumped in here unless the revivification pad setup was used as a jump entrance point&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Even this is only possible with something strange.</li>
<li>Figure was plausibly re-animated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zephyr">Zephyr</h3>
<ul>
<li>Has developed a sort of mind storage receptacle.</li>
<li>Going into the past, taking the mind from just before death, storing it on a time SSD, and putting it into the new body.</li>
<li>Possibility: Plans, etc. about the body swap device could have been stolen.</li>
<li>Messes with the person&rsquo;s internal time engine. Since the watch-person connection is severed by death, but then reignited by revivification.</li>
<li><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Zephyr recognised the scarred man. Jake Robertson, assistant at other ChronoCo lab, connections to other factions, suspected Secondhand agent. Leitborn or Tuhorn recommended him to Zephyr&rsquo;s research group. Possibility: One copy of them stole Council secrets, other stole plans from the lab.</li>
<li><strong>Takeaway</strong>: The clown&rsquo;s revivification of scarman and shenanigans are what caused this to happen.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="temporal-physics-details">Temporal Physics Details</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scarman died at some point in time.</li>
<li>The death basically messed up their watch&rsquo;s timeline, i.e their internal timeline as tracked by their watch.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>First Theory</p>
<ul>
<li>They were brought back ~3 days later, so by watchtower <em>age</em> they&rsquo;re 3 days younger than by watchtower <em>time</em>.</li>
<li>Since their watch was only tracking them for \(T-3\) days, and watchtower time was running for \(T\) days.</li>
<li><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Basically, their watch says their \(T-3\) days old, watchtower says their T days old. If dies in 2023, and revive in 2024, their Watch says they haven&rsquo;t aged, out of sync with watch timeline</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Second Theory</p>
<ul>
<li>Death is just turning back the clock on internal time, and thus on their watch time.</li>
<li>Eg: You die at 32. I pull your 31 year old mind back into your resurrected body. Your personal watch says you are 31. Body is in 2024, mind could plausibly be from 2023.</li>
<li>The missing piece that Zephyr&rsquo;s stuck on is working on pulling the mind from the past. He says he&rsquo;d be interested in hints towards that.</li>
<li>3 days: Revivification makes them confused, because of the 3 day time drift. It&rsquo;s like 4 dimensional jet lag I think.</li>
<li><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Revival could have messed up the clock, because there&rsquo;s a conflict between it being \(32\) years since their birth (watchtower time) and their mind only being \(31\) years old (personal watch time, and also actual age)</li>
</ul>
