<ul>
<li>Who got Tasha a receptacle? Frog probably involved (stolen from)</li>

<li>Receptacle chamber in Tasha&#39;s house, whose? Remember she had a receptacle manual, that was stored with the letters from mysterious person. Inchresting</li>
<li>From Breacher: Lost in transit means that a shipment of receptacles was stolen from the frog - perhaps given to Tasha, perhaps even to Scarman.</li>

Speculation
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>Implication from the conversation we overheard: Selene was put onto this trail by someone else. Perhaps Madame E, perhaps a chance conversation with a Secondhander on a mission, perhaps something arranged.</li>
<li>So, someone sent Tuhorn here.  Someone also sent Selene here. Tasha sent the Secondhand here.</li>
<li>Tasha needed a Watcher to discover this place. So a watcher was helping Tasha before Tasha was in the weeds.</li>
<li>The big question is the unclosed part of this catch 22. So Tasha needed a Watcher to start chasing this down. And we have &#34;Selene should know, she&#39;s told me so much&#34; from the journal.</li>
<li>Tuhorn convo: Hinted it wasn&#39;t him who tipped off Selene. So the loop extends.</li>
<li>Clues about Madame E have been thin on the ground. She&#39;s hiding and up to something, but what? Was she the prime mover in this?</li>

Tasha&#39;s Will
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-25" class="outline-text-4">
<p>I think I&#39;ve mentioned this to Breacher already, but we know now that Anderson is a major player. Also, the only people left stuff by Tasha were [redacted knight councillor], Tuhorn, Selene, and Anderson. I wonder if:</p>
<ol>
<li>Her militarisation and escalation of the war is entirely accidental, or if she knows more than she&#39;s letting on (even if she doesn&#39;t have the full picture. e.g - she just knows there&#39;s going to be a massive war, and she wants ChronoCo to win. Even then, it&#39;s curious how she learned whatever she did)</li>
<li>Tasha/Selene/etc. knew something about her significance (and if so, what? Anything we don&#39;t know?)</li>
<li>asha/Selene/etc. had any active or planned operations involving her - like trying to investigate, bring down, recruit, etc, and in particular if anything is set in motion that we can build on top off if we need.</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of this is irrelevant to our actions - we need to stop Anderson regardless of how intentional she&#39;s being and regardless of how much Tasha knew about her - but they&#39;re still worth looking into and might help us unravel the mystery a bit further.</p>
