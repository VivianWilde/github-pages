** Hobbies
- Pensively staring out into the middle distance while blowing bubbles instead of smoking a cigarette.
- Going to speakeasies to pick up on rumours and news, asking for "a rum and coke, hold the rum. And make it a strong one", and watching the bartender try to figure out if it's some kind of trick.
- Time Candy Crush, but only the complex-numbered levels. Anything else isn't worth her time.
- Four-dimensional Sudoku

** Accomplishments
- Officially deemed a bigger threat than a small squadron of Knights, by none other than Malachai von Spatz himself.
