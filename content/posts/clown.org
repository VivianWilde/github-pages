- Secret
- Who knows if paradoxes apply in the tower?
- Contingency plan for the eldritch horror
- Strike a deal with him to force him to erase himself
- He's obligated to take deals and negotiate
- Don't tell Breacher: If she's in on this, she might try to use it for something.
- Clown-jecture: We'll need bloodshed to end this
- Clown is willing to
- "As a last resort"
- Don't tell Breacher. She might try something to get the upper hand, strike a bargain with paradox, which would be a risk.
- Last resort: Kill agressive councillors, make a deal with the devil
- She mentioned talking to Mr. Time with Jett, which is a risk.

- Paradox only has as much power as you give him.
- So don't bring Breacher.
- Breacher sees paradox as limitless, so we can't let him in on this.
- So keep Breacher out.
- Downplay Paradox's power
- Keep brewing our plots and plans
- If we're clever, it's a battle of belief. We need belief.
- Keep breacher out, breacher thinks it's god/devil.
