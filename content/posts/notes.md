### Receptacle {#receptacle}

Adel Boiss - Persian Spy
W: +3   A: +4    T: +2    C:+2    H:+0
Ability - Persian Connections: The Persians, an opposing military force, trust Boiss's decrees...


### Case {#case}

Temporal anomaly - symptoms of sickness, etc.


### NPC: Selene {#npc-selene}

Assistant to Madame E, Watcher
We've worked together, casually.


### Notes {#notes}

-   A thief escaped and disappeared into the timestream, stole a list of some sensitive info


### Time {#time}

-   Exits: One, presumably a thief
-   Exit to ancient greece around 500BC, caused a ripple leading to a break in 480.

<!--listend-->

-   Knights are going to attack the secondhand revolution.
-   Some are out investigating?


### Athens {#athens}

Persian invasion never got this far

It helped with the fleet. s
We had spies in politics.
We had help with the fleet.
Phoenicians helped Persians nuke the fleet.
This is fine.
Battle of Salamas - big battle, Phoenicians + Persians + Ionians vs misc Greeks.
They should have failed, in this timeline they succeeded

500: In Salamas, Th was attacked + captured by pirates, needed to be bailed out by council ransom, lost face.
Ar rose in prestige after that.
Scribe investigated, did the payments, we have a name to seek out.


### 500 {#500}

Strange figures arrived recently:
Nobleman with a strange pulsing scar
Athenian, doing an inspection of merchant goods

The nobleman is the more interesting one.

Someone at the docks is basically trafficking/smuggling. Perhaps he's had some business recently.
Odd requests: Scar man wanted something in a box carried to a contact.

Questions: Who was the contact.

Bald man introduced scarman to Man in black, heavily armed

Man in black - Pointy sticks across the chest.
Advanced modern weaponry?


#### Cold case! {#cold-case}

5 hours before we landed, the bald merchant introduced scarman to the man in black

Morgan commits scarman details to memory

Pirate has a bandolier and a bow

Pirate's name: Adamantius

Bald guy: Baldius

Box seems about 10th century, way out of time.
Heavy, probably concerning.

Rosemary got a 20! In a d12 system! WTF!
g


## <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2024-06-07 Fri&gt;</span></span>Murder!! {#murder}

People are piling in.
No councilors
No Selene!

Holland is talking to a Watcher
Tuhorn is talking to a mouse hole.


## <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2024-06-09 Sun&gt;</span></span>Ace Squad {#ace-squad}


### Timeline (new entries) {#timeline--new-entries}

-   9:30-12: Council Meeting
-   12:30: Tasha visited Alec
-   ~12:30: Tasha got a text from Alex saying "I'll kill you if you tell anyone about this", but previous messages are very chill. So text might be a ruse???
-   1:30: Tasha working at the union office
-   3:30 Emergency Meeting: Tasha, Clinton, Doe, Tuhorn, and a full list of others were late and the Lone Master sent a rep.


### Tasha {#tasha}

-   Alec mentioned Tasha had been acting strange recently
-   Alec: "Tasha knew something before she died."
-   Tasha had been frantic recently, terrified, not her usual optimistic self. Talking to shady figures (shady by Alec standards). For the past few weeks.
-   Been running back to her estate mid-day, even missing meetings for it.
-   Tasha ostensibly never jumped, recently started asking Alec about time tech and trying to acquire a watch (about a month ago)
-   Potential Lead: Alec put Tasha in touch with some contact about acquiring a watch.
-   She's been in the knights district frequently.
-   Potential Lead: Clinton and Tasha had a lot to discuss, and Tasha was raising eyebrows at Clinton in the council meeting on her deathday.
-   (Probably nothing) Tasha was really into "Moon Detective", a bad scifi detective TV show from the 50s.


### Estate {#estate}

-   Holly wanted to buy the estate, pissed that Miri has it
-   Library: Political structure of the watchtower, and books from across time.
-   Library: Dr Zephyrs books "The Trouble with T.I.M.E" about timeline ruptures and stabilisation, and "Living your next life: Quasi-temporal revivification". (NOTE: Jane Doe heard a revivification talk in the council, did not like it, for unspecified reasons)
-   Crest in the wall behind the library.
-   Golden key on the coffee table, don't know what it unlocks.
-   Two bedrooms, both in use recently. So Tasha was living with someone.


### Journal {#journal}

-   I don't have enough time. I need to find it before they do.
-   Selene should know, she's told me so much.
-   As long as I can get to the other time I can figure out.
    "There's no receptacle though, it can't be used".
-   I feel like I'm going crazy
-   The fact that nobody knows makes them the crazy one.
-   "Worried about Madame E and Selene. Don't know if I can trust them. But I need to know"
-   "I think it's Holly. Something about that mining operation. She's been hiding something from the whole council. Another timeline?"
-   She's not just mining for time fluid.


### Corkboard {#corkboard}

-   Found in Tasha's office
-   Rosemary, Holly, Frog, some businessman, and some mysterious armored figure in the chronoCo column.
-   Frog: "Lost in transit", Armed figure: "Tester"
-   Thorwald elsewhere crossed out, "knows about it" (that is also crossed out), "useful idiot"
-   ?? over a blue tab (watchers?), pictures of Lone Master, Jane Doe, and Whisperer and the British cane dude (Marlow)
-   Trashcan has pictures of Madame E and Selene.


### Letter {#letter}

-   The letter iRS carefully not frantic, unlike the journal entries from the same time.


#### Invisible Ink {#invisible-ink}

-   Triplets of numbers, in the form `(page, line, char)`.
-   Book key at the top. "Time War"
-   Actual message: From Tasha: "Night knowledge collected. Worried about watch agent. Buy the wax seal stamp."
-   Adress: "Aunt Mildred", some time-hopping contact. Addressed to Pompeii


### Computer {#computer}

-   Holly ghosted Tasha's attempts to fish for information
-   Small message group ("book club"), exchanged book names, possibly a way to share message keys.
-   Mentions of "the end, the storm", ostensibly film. Someone "worried about the franchise"
-   Tasha asked Holly for support on making minutemen official faction
-   Someone (her contact in Pompeii) visited 2 months ago.
-   3 watchtower agents implicated in this. We have their contacts, need to trace them. Scarred man was probably one of them.


### Desk {#desk}

Stuff we found in a locked desk drawer. The drawer was booby-trapped with a poison dart, and caught fire once opened.


#### Film (Collection of disconnected scenes) {#film--collection-of-disconnected-scenes}

-   People bowing to a giant gold chronoCo logo and Holly Holland walking out
-   Mining operations on Earth, probably an alternate-timeline or historical earth. This earth looks less polluted/trashed than ours. Different infrastructure - the mining looks like an entire mining "district". Looks like it was built anew, rather than on top of an existing city. Looks like it was built to be a mining operation and has been solely a mining operation for a while. Desert: Bombed/fallout vibes. Building and a pool are the only nice features, and a towel saying "LRS" (NOTE: Tasha had an LRS handkerchief)
-   Blue haired middle-aged man: Roughly matches the description of Malachai von Spatz, from the lore. Perhaps a relative or younger version, but perhaps not. Might be an alternate-timeline version of him, but that's unlikely.
-   Final shot: Icy background, someone looking for something. Right: Orange haired 18 year old waving at camera, points to a tetrahedron.


#### Letters Archive {#letters-archive}

-   To Tasha: "The Last Resort. Enemy of my Enemy. Hall not here." Weeks/months ago
-   To Tasha: "Stealing the Truth, three thirty. Time Man Helping. Distract. Knight Facts Needed." Recent, close to death day
-   From Tasha: "Night knowledge collected. Worried about watch agent. Buy the wax seal stamp." Recent, unsent
-   We found a receptacle manual
-   Burned letters: One dates to a year ago.
-   "Time Man helping". And we have a "Mr TIME"


### Councillors (We talked to Holly and Jane) {#councillors--we-talked-to-holly-and-jane}

-   Purple scarman stole the data
-   Working for Secondhand Revolution
-   So Tasha probably was as well
-   Original scarman died, Jane wants to talk to ours.


#### Council Meeting {#council-meeting}

-   Tasha was in the 930-12 council meeting.
-   Tasha defended accepting time refugee. Holland opposes
-   Zephyr gave a speech on revivification
-   Tasha argued for making the minutemen official
-   Some talk about automatons, and updates from knight commander.


## <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2024-06-14 Fri&gt;</span></span>Death Valley Knights {#death-valley-knights}

-   Lord Commander MacIntyre meeting: Internal security (Time MI5)
-   Stolen intel: 36 hours unaccounted for, enough time for the code to have been decrypted. Could be Hemlock.
-   Florence Scarred Man: Stole ChronoCo stuff from the tower and fled. Unaffiliated or SecondHand
-   Salamas Scarred Man: Hemlock.
-   Goals: Find out where the information went, how it was stolen. Learn about the men and where they came from.
-   Stolen again somewhere between Florence and Italy.
-   The missing 36 hours is between the Egypt recovery and the return to Tower custody. Conjecture: Spy in the Wednesday group.


### Salamas Guy {#salamas-guy}

-   Was being interrogated by Clinton


#### Good Cop Bad Cop {#good-cop-bad-cop}

-   Lightning Gun : Standard High Tech
-   Eight step plan of world domination
-   First step: Trickery, done
-   Second step has happened now. or will happen now. You'll never know.
-   When the skies turn red and the dinosaurs rain from above.
-   Reagan: Your opinions wont be what you want, but I assure you we're still evil.
-   We're behind every inconvenience
-   Third: Those that have risen shall fall, those that fell have already risen and shall rise to the highest spire
-   Fourth: Be careful what you wish for, those that come. New leaders not who you think they are.
-   Fifth: Step away from the TIME man.
-   Percentages, really
-   Dinosaurs: Maybe a little more literal than metaphorical. You'll see. You have to stop it as it happens, and then before it happens. Some kind of paradox. But he implies it won't stop the overall plan.


#### Cold Case {#cold-case}

-   Cold Case stops 3.5 days ago. I took temporal damage, which is... bad
-   In a morgue somewhere, person dressed in clown makeup is above him, and he runs, until pulled into Watcher custody.
-   So this is the scarman who was killed in Florence.
-   Timeline is weird.
-   3.5 days ago in his personal timeline, Salamas man woke up with a clown staring over his head, and got taken into watcher custody - the thing that should have happened to Florence man 6 hours ago.
-   Likely not receptacle shenanigans, instead time fuckery.
-   Only possibility (under known rules): At 3.5 days ago, Salamas man was receptacle-possessing Florence man
-   Internal consistency has been broken
-   Basically: Cold Case should always respect watchtower time. But, this time, personal time overruled - 3.5 days ago cold-case time was 6 hours ago watchtower time.
-   Basically: T-3.5d Salamas receptacled into T-6h Florence. And so was receptacled for the resurrection.


#### Chocolate Croissant! {#chocolate-croissant}

-   TODO I missed some stuff up here, Enigma can fill in
-   "Strange clown has messed up my watch"
-   Messed up: Hint that this was unintentional
-   "Travelled back with my old self, not my new"
-   "Always be a bit behind, provides quite a bit of advantage in the Watchtower"
-   "Enough future knowledge to cause chaos"
-   "Morgana and Breacher are onto you" (You as in Hemlock)


#### After {#after}

-   Salamas man ran out from time labs, Florence came from council. That checks out, Florence guy stole something from the council.
-   Salamas man knew revivification was in his future, and he was rooting around the lab studying revivification.


### Time Labs {#time-labs}

-   Lockdown: Door, windows barricaded
-   Accident in the labs: Zephyr is trapped, infestation of zombies
-   Resulted from failed experiments with revivification - the bodies were fine, but failed to bring the minds/brains back (I'm hazy on the distincting)
-   We fought through zombies, saved some, Damien killed a bunch of innocents, yada yada yada


#### Footage {#footage}

-   Scarred man leaving the lab, corroborates out-of-lab footage.
-   "They couldn't have jumped in here unless the revivification pad setup was used as a jump entrance point".
-   Even this is only possible with something strange.
-   Figure was plausibly re-animated.


### Zephyr {#zephyr}

-   Has developed a sort of mind storage receptacle.
-   Going into the past, taking the mind from just before death, storing it on a time SSD, and putting it into the new body.
-   Possibility: Plans, etc. about the body swap device could have been stolen.
-   Messes with the person's internal time engine. Since the watch-person connection is severed by death, but then reignited by revivification.
-   **Takeaway**: Zephyr recognised the scarred man. Jake Robertson, assistant at other ChronoCo lab, connections to other factions, suspected Secondhand agent. Leitborn or Tuhorn recommended him to Zephyr's research group. Possibility: One copy of them stole Council secrets, other stole plans from the lab.
-   **Takeaway**: The clown's revivification of scarman and shenanigans are what caused this to happen.


#### Temporal Physics Details {#temporal-physics-details}

-   Scarman died at some point in time.
-   The death basically messed up their watch's timeline, i.e their internal timeline as tracked by their watch.

<!--list-separator-->

-  First Theory

    -   They were brought back ~3 days later, so by watchtower _age_ they're 3 days younger than by watchtower _time_.
    -   Since their watch was only tracking them for \\(T-3\\) days, and watchtower time was running for \\(T\\) days.
    -   **Takeaway**: Basically, their watch says their \\(T-3\\) days old, watchtower says their T days old. If dies in 2023, and revive in 2024, their Watch says they haven't aged, out of sync with watch timeline

<!--list-separator-->

-  Second Theory

    -   Death is just turning back the clock on internal time, and thus on their watch time.
    -   Eg: You die at 32. I pull your 31 year old mind back into your resurrected body. Your personal watch says you are 31. Body is in 2024, mind could plausibly be from 2023.
    -   The missing piece that Zephyr's stuck on is working on pulling the mind from the past. He says he'd be interested in hints towards that.
    -   3 days: Revivification makes them confused, because of the 3 day time drift. It's like 4 dimensional jet lag I think.
    -   **Takeaway**: Revival could have messed up the clock, because there's a conflict between it being \\(32\\) years since their birth (watchtower time) and their mind only being \\(31\\) years old (personal watch time, and also actual age)


### Final Bombshell {#final-bombshell}

-   Salamas fucker escaped for real, three knights killed, Salamas fucker is now missing.


#### Leads {#leads}

-   The Clown: Ask him about why the revivification was wonky
-   The Florence fucker
