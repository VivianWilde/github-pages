* Secrets: Wednesday Traitor
- Stolen intel: 36 hours unaccounted for, enough time for the code to have been decrypted. Could be Hemlock.
- Stolen again somewhere between Florence and Italy.
- The missing 36 hours is between the Egypt recovery and the return to Tower custody. Conjecture: Spy in the Wednesday group.

* Leads
- LRS/Last Resort
- Selene's house
- Clinton
- Mr Time
- Reagan??
- Holly's advanced tech
- Malachai in the film
- Pompeii
- "Freedom of the Watchtower", secondhand club
- What was the Kaleidoscope thing
- Receptacle chamber in Tasha's house, whose?
- Remember she had a receptacle manual, that was stored with the letters from mysterious person. Inchresting
- Thorwald: Useful idiot, also knight was involved in the murder.
- Rosemary: She doesn't know why she's on the board, we can talk with her.
- Vault door
- Last Resort, Under the Lake
** Tuhorn
- Will: A sculpture of a frog for Councilor Tuhorn of the Forest
- Tuhorn opposes everything in council 
- Might have sent Jake Robertson
- Was late to emergency meeting
- Works with animals, and we have the chimpanzee dead drop

* Putting Pieces Together
- LRS shows up a lot
- Tasha "no receptacle, it can't be used". In light of recent receptacle-related plans and shenanigans, how much did she know about the secondhand/hemlock/robertson body-swap timehop bullshit.
- Clinton's showing up a lot.
** Receptacle
- Receptacle tank and manual on Tasha's estate
- Question: Could you receptacle into someone, say 3 days ago outside the watchtower, and then that body enters the watchtower (via either time-travelling their body in, or just physically walking in)
- Say, by using the auxiliary time engine to beam in?
- Cold case insights: Knight officer, gold, soft hands


* What we know
- Holly is doing mysterious mining for not time fluid without council knowledge 
- Tasha was collaborating with the second hand revolution
- Selene was feeding her info somehow
- Second-hand engineered a theft and a distraction by the scarred men.
* Leads on finding Selene
- Selene's house
- Miri?
- Interrogate scarman
- Revivification
- Tilda - what did she tell Tasha?
- "Enemy of my enemy" might refer to Selene
- kaleidoscope object
- last resort/lrs

* Outline
- lrs stands for last resort? The place? 
- so conjecture - traveled to resort seeking Holly, found Selene also investigating (enemy of my enemy). 
- possibility - advanced tech Holly is mining parts for. "tester".
